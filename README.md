This project requires:
- Arduino Nano (or any ATmega328P);
- TM1638 display;
- PWM 12v Fan (that one with 4-pin connector)
- A breadboard
- 10K Ohm resistor
- 10K Thermistor
- Some wires
- A 12v PSU
- A 5v PSU (or USB cable)

-----------------------------
Objectives:
This project reads a thermistor value, convert it in Celsius, shows on display and activates the Fan based on temperature.
-----------------------------
What is this for?
Beyond the obvious (read temperatures), you can control any PWM device based on temperature, like exhaustion systems, peltier systems

* All the connections are shown in the Fritzing schema
